# Flutter Feature First Architecture Template

## Project Overview

This project is a template code collection for adopting the Flutter Feature-First architecture.
It was created as a reference for developing new Flutter projects.

## Purpose

- Provide design guidelines for new project development
- Demonstrate implementation examples of Feature-First architecture
- Share consistent coding conventions and best practices
- Offer reusable patterns and components

## Implementation Notes

1. Follow the design principles of this template
2. Maintain appropriate directory structure
3. Use consistent naming conventions
4. Prioritize beautiful design and user experience
5. Clearly separate business logic for each feature

## Design and Implementation Rules

For detailed design principles and implementation rules, please refer to the following documents:

- [flutter-feature-first.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/flutter-feature-first.mdc) Architecture overview
- [domain.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/domain.mdc) Domain layer implementation rules
- [infrastructure.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/infrastructure.mdc) Infrastructure layer implementation rules
- [presentation.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/presentation.mdc) Presentation layer implementation rules
- [riverpod.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/riverpod.mdc) Riverpod implementation guidelines
- [widget.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/widget.mdc) Widget implementation rules
- [test-code.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/test-code.mdc) Test code implementation rules
- [package.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/package.mdc) Package usage guidelines

Utilize these rules to aim for high-quality Flutter application development with excellent maintainability and scalability.
